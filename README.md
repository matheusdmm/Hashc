# Hashc
A study of hashing in C, to learn from the ground how the mechanism works and to implement it in a little project.

The current state of the project is: Unfinished.

#   How it works
Hashing is a cryptographic process that validates the authenticity and integrity of something in the digital realm. 
It is a one-way process, that is, you do it one time to a certain file or input, and it generates a fixed value called hash that is unique to that file or input. If you change a bit that file or input the hash gonna change and that is exactly the purpose of that.

#   Why?
Because C does not provide a hashing library, so it would be cool to read articles and do some research about this subject to try to implement it.
Also because C is blazing fast and gives a good but fair fight when coding unknown things (and also because it is one of the most beautiful codes).

#   What it can do
Still working and learning on it.

## /Etc
to do.

```c
gcc -o hash_table.c
```

It was made using [IntelliJ Clion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), [C language](https://www.iso.org/standard/74528.html), [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
